# Github Merge Madness Sentinel

## Description

Tired of accidentally merging your changes into the wrong branch on Github? Fear not! The Github PR Alert Chrome Extension is here to save the day! This incredible extension alerts you whenever you're about to merge into the treacherous realms of the main or master branch. It adds visual indicators and a warning message, ensuring you stay on the right track (or branch).

## Features

- **Smart Detection**: Our extension is like a genius detective that can sniff out PR pages on Github and quickly determine if the destination branch is either main or master. Sherlock Holmes would be proud!
- **Visual Indicators**: Prepare to have your attention grabbed like never before! The extension highlights the destination branch in the PR header, making it pop like a disco ball at a party. It's impossible to miss!
- **Warning Message**: We've got your back with a friendly warning message.
- **Customizable Styling**: Don't like the default styles? No problemo! You can easily modify the extension's CSS to match your unique taste. Go wild with colours, fonts, and whatever tickles your fancy.

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to install the Github PR Alert Chrome Extension and embark on an epic quest to conquer the right branch:

1. Clone or download the extension code from the [repository](https://github.com/davinator/merge-madness-sentinel). Don't worry, no dragons or fire-breathing lizards will be encountered during this step.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Embrace your inner adventurer and enable the **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner. You're now a certified explorer of Chrome extensions!
4. Channel your inner explorer once again and click on the **Load unpacked** button. Choose the folder where you saved the extension code. 
No code in this extension was designed to steal your passwords or mine bitcoins in your computer. Trust me, bro.
5. Behold! The extension will be installed and activated automatically, like magic! You're now equipped with the power to conquer branches with confidence.

## How It Works

The extension uses highly intelligent, state-of-the art algorithms to perform a series of tasks in the blink of an eye:

1. Extract the destination branch from the PR header by skillfully analyzing its text.
2. With the grace of a ballet dancer, the extension will apply CSS styles that transform the PR header into a visual masterpiece. Making the destination branch very, very visible.
3. It also inserts a warning message above the merge button. So even if you're as short-memory as the author of this repository that you could forget the destination branch while scrolling down to reach the merge button, you'll have another warning!

## Compatibility

The Github PR Alert Chrome Extension is compatible with the latest version of Google Chrome and works its magic on Github's website. Unfortunately, it doesn't grant magical powers on other websites or pages. We're still working on that spell!
